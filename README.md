# Machine Learning Project with Gradio and Web Components

This project consists of two main components: a Gradio-based interface for direct model interaction and a separate web application with an API backend.

## Project Structure

## Gradio Interface

The Gradio interface provides a standalone, user-friendly way to interact with our machine learning model.

### Features
- Direct model predictions
- Interactive input components
- Real-time results

### Running the Gradio App
1. Navigate to the gradio_app directory
2. Install requirements
3. Run the Gradio server

## Web Application

### Frontend
Our web application provides a more customized interface for model interaction.

### API Backend
The API serves as the bridge between the frontend and the machine learning model.

#### API Endpoints
- `/predict` - Get model predictions
- `/status` - Check API status

[Screenshot placeholder: Add a screenshot of a successful API response using tools like Postman]

### Running the Web Application

#### Starting the API Server
1. Navigate to the api directory
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the server

#### Starting the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the development server
